### Description
This is the project repository for the RDF Master Manager developed for the module SGSE in the summer term 2023 at Hochschule Bielefeld.

The target of the project was to implement the datastructure described in [N. Brisaboa et al, Space/time-efficient RDF stores based on
circular suffix sorting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10045.pdf) and extend the datastructure with the ability to add and delete triples.
On top of the datastructure a web app was developed to visualize the currently loaded dataset textually, in 2D and 3D and support the adding and deleting of triples.
